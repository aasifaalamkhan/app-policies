# Privacy Policy for OneShot.ai

**Effective Date:** August 2, 2025

Thank you for using OneShot.ai ("the App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and share your information when you use our mobile application. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

To provide and improve our services, we collect several different types of information.

### A. Information You Provide to Us

* **Account Information:** When you sign in with Google, we collect your name, email address, and profile picture URL as provided by your Google account.
* **User Content (Input Images):** We collect the images you upload from your device's gallery. These images are the primary input for our AI video generation service.
* **Custom Prompts:** We collect the text prompts you write when you choose the "Use Custom Prompt" feature.
* **Review Verification (Optional):** If you choose to claim the review bonus, we collect the screenshot of your app review that you upload.
* **Consent Records:** We record your confirmation that you are 18 or older and that you agree to our Terms & Conditions and this Privacy Policy.

### B. Information We Collect Automatically

* **Task Data:** We automatically create and store metadata about your video generation tasks, including the task ID, status (e.g., PENDING, SUCCEEDED, FAILED), token cost, the public URL of your input image, and the prompt used.
* **Generated Content:** We store the URL of the final video generated by the AI.
* **Usage and Device Information:** Like most mobile applications, we may collect basic usage information through third-party services like Firebase to identify crashes, fix bugs, and understand how users interact with the App.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

* **To Provide the Core Service:** To process your input images and prompts to generate AI videos.
* **To Manage Your Account:** To create and maintain your account, and to show your token balance and profile information.
* **To Display Your Creations:** To list your past and current video tasks in the "My Videos" section of the App.
* **To Process Transactions:** To manage in-app purchases of token packs through the Google Play Store and RevenueCat.
* **To Provide Customer Support:** To respond to your requests and to verify bonus claims, such as the app review bonus.
* **To Improve Our App:** To monitor and analyze usage, fix bugs, and improve the functionality and user experience of the App.
* **To Enforce Our Terms:** To ensure compliance with our Terms and Conditions and prevent misuse of the platform.

## 3. Data Storage and Retention

We are committed to retaining your data only for as long as necessary to provide our services.

* **Input Images & Review Screenshots:** Your uploaded images are stored temporarily on Backblaze B2's secure servers. These files are only used for the video generation process or to verify a review bonus and are not stored permanently.
* **Generated Videos:** The final videos are stored by our AI service provider (Alibaba Cloud) and are accessible in the "My Videos" screen. They are retained until you choose to delete the task from within the App. Deleting a task permanently removes it from your account view.
* **Account and Task Data:** Your user account information (email, name, token balance) and task metadata are stored in Google's Firestore database. This data is retained as long as your account is active to ensure you have access to your videos and token balance. If you delete your account, this information will be permanently removed.
* **Local Data:** The App may temporarily store files (such as cropped images or videos for sharing) in your device's local temporary directory. This data is cleared automatically by the operating system or when the action (e.g., sharing) is complete.

## 4. Third-Party Services and Data Sharing

We do not sell your personal information. However, we share information with trusted third-party services that help us operate and improve the App. These services are contractually obligated to protect your data.

* **Google (Firebase & Google Sign-In):** We use Google for user authentication and as our backend database provider (Firestore).
* **Alibaba Cloud (DashScope):** This is our core AI partner. The public URLs of your input images and your text prompts are sent to their API to generate the videos.
* **Backblaze B2:** We use Backblaze for secure, temporary cloud storage of your input images and review screenshots.
* **RevenueCat & Google Play Store:** We use RevenueCat to manage in-app purchases, which are processed securely by the Google Play Store. We do not handle or store your credit card information.
* **`url_launcher`:** To direct you to our app page on the Google Play Store.
* **`share_plus`:** To allow you to share your generated videos with other apps on your device.

We recommend you review the privacy policies of these third-party services to understand how they handle your data.

## 5. Your Rights and Choices

* **Access and Deletion:** You can access and delete your generated videos at any time from the "My Videos" screen.
* **Account Deletion:** To permanently delete your account and all associated data, please contact us at diffusionx.ai@gmail.com.
* **Device Permissions:** You can manage the App's access to your device's gallery and other permissions through your device's settings menu.
* **Sign Out:** You can sign out of your account at any time through the Profile screen.

## 6. Data Security

We implement commercially reasonable security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no electronic transmission or storage system is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## 7. Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 18. If we become aware that we have collected such information, we will take steps to delete it immediately.

## 8. International Data Transfers

Our services are global, and your information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than your own (including the United States, Singapore, and others where our service providers operate). These countries may have data protection laws that are different from those in your country (India).

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new policy in the App or via email. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
