# Privacy Policy for Subliminal Images

**Effective Date:** June 20, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Subliminal Images ("the App") handles your information. The App is designed to be a private, personal tool, and your privacy is our top priority.

### Information We Collect

Subliminal Images collects and stores the following information **only on your local device**:

1.  **Image Identifiers (URIs):** When you select images from your device, the App saves a reference (a Uniform Resource Identifier or URI) to those images. This is necessary to access and display them during your flashing sessions. The App does not copy, upload, or transmit your actual image files anywhere.
2.  **User Settings:** The App saves your preferred settings, such as flash interval, duration, opacity, location, and image size. This is done to restore your settings the next time you open the App, providing a seamless user experience.

All of this information is stored locally in the App's private directory on your device using Android's standard SharedPreferences system.

### How We Use Your Information

The information collected is used exclusively to provide the core functionality of the App:
* To access and display the images you have selected.
* To apply your custom settings to the flashing sessions.
* To restore your images and settings when you reopen the App.

**We do not collect, transmit, share, or sell any of your personal information or app usage data.** All data remains on your device.

### Permissions Used

* **Display over other apps (`SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`):** This permission is essential for the App's primary function, which is to display your chosen images on top of other applications as a system overlay. The App cannot function as intended without this permission.
* **Foreground Service (`FOREGROUND_SERVICE`):** This permission is used to allow the flashing service to continue running when the App is in the background, ensuring your sessions are not interrupted. A persistent notification is shown to keep you aware that the service is active.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
